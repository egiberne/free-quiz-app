# Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz

# Step 1 
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a `lang` attribute to your `html` element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.

# Step 2
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.

Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.



# Step 33
If you click on the radio inputs, you might notice both inputs within the same true/false fieldset can be selected at the same time.

Group the relevant inputs together such that only one input from a pair can be selected at a time.


# Step 34
To prevent unnecessary repetition, target the before pseudo-element of the p element, and give it a content property of "Question #".
